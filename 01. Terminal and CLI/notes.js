//Normally we use GUI (Graphical User Interface)
// --> It means interacting with the system based on the graphics (pictures) that we see on the screen


// 1) CLI :-
// --> In windows, we have two options
// a) CMD (command prompt)
// b) Windows Powershell

// The whole software is a terminal and inside it has two shells named above
// Both these shells are based on DOS
// Windows powershell is better of the two



//Commands :-
// a) ls :- list all the folders in the current location

// b) cd :- change directory
// --> It is used to change the current working directory
// --> To go back use "cd ../"
// --> To go front use "cd next_folder_name"
// --> If a folder name contains spaces then, wrap it in a string with single quotes
// --> Use "tab" key to have a shortcut while writing name

// c) CTRL + L
// --> Helps to scroll the whole screen up

// d) To play a file(img, video, music) present in the current folder
// --> Just type the the file name and press enter

// e) To make a new folder in the current folder (only one folder at a time in windows powershell)
// --> Use "mkdir folder_name"

// f) To delete a file or a folder permanently
// --> use "rm file/folder_name"

// g) To open the current folder in VS CODE
// --> use "code ."

// f) To get the path of current working directory
// --> use "pwd"



//2) Gitbash :-
// --> The shell provided by Git
// --> It is based on linux
